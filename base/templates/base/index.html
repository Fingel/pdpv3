<h1>Hi, I'm Austin Riba.</h1>
<p>
  I've been writing code for almost as long as I've been riding a bike. Over this time I've taken on the role of a generalist with experience in full stack development,
  devops and product management.
</p>
<p>
    I installed Linux on to my home computer in 6th grade and began web
    development shortly thereafter.
    I was excited by the possibility of being able to build something and
    share it with the world. I still get excited about that to this day.
</p>

<h2>Software Development</h2>
<p>
I'm happy to jump into existing projects and I excel at starting products from scratch. Taking an idea and turning it into a tangible
product is one of my favorite aspects of development. I can work with you through the process of requirement gathering, architecture, development, deployment and iteration.
</p>
<p>
  I may be available for software consultancy.
  <a href="mailto:austin@pedaldrivenprogramming.com">Contact me</a> if you are interested in working together.
</p>

<p>If you meet me in person, chances are I'll be wearing a pair of bike shoes with my laptop on my back. Not only is cycling one of my biggest hobbies, I believe in the bike's enormous potential to transform our lives through positive impacts on the environment, economics, social interaction, city planning and personal health. I <a href="/categories/cycling">write about it</a> from time to time.
