I recently received the following email in my Trail Care inbox (names and locations removed):

This is a controversial subject within the mountain biking community,
especially within the advocacy circles. Pretty much everyone has
an opinion about Strava. Some people love it, some hate it, any everyone has
their theories.

What nobody has is any data to back up their arguments. None.

Nobody can prove that Strava encourages illegal trail riding.  You'd have to
hang at the bottom of an illegal trail for months and ask every rider where they
found out about it, compare it to months of data prior to Strava coming into
existence, and even then you'd only (maybe) be able to come to a conclusion for
that one trail.

You can't prove that Strava doesn't encourage illegal trail riding either - but
not being able to prove a negative does not prove a positive.

When people say that Strava encourages illegal riding what they might really be
saying is that the narrative makes sense to them. It is also very easy to blame
a scapegoat, Especially when it's a phone app coming out of Silicon Valley. I
get it: I have sympathy for people that feel like phone apps have no business
out on the trails. But to each their own, right?

Unfortunately telling people that they can't prove Strava is a problem doesn't
really win any arguments. - people much prefer anecdotal and circumstantial
evidence. So I'll give you some of my personal theories:

I (as I hope I made clear) have no idea if Strava contributes to illegal trail
riding. What it surely does is make it more visible to non mountain bikers.
Illegal mountain bike trails have existed since people first started riding
bikes off road, but maybe not too many people knew that it was happening. Trust
me, it has been. You would especially think that land managers/owners might
prefer to think that Strava is contributing to more people riding illegal trails
when in reality they have been all along, right under their noses!

As for speed, I have to think that's most likely bullocks. Mountain bikers love
to go fast, otherwise they'd be hikers. Mountain bikes have
gotten a lot faster in the last decade, at the same time the sport has become
much more accessible and popular. This will of course result in occasional
conflicts on multi use trails.

So in short: while I have no idea, I highly doubt Strava contributes
significantly to increased use of illegal trails.  Southern California
especially, with it's very few and overcrowded trails, faces huge challenges in
land and recreational management. Blaming a scapegoat doesn't actually solve any
problems.  Land managers and other trail users need to work with mountain bikers
to come up with real solutions, not blame some silly app.
