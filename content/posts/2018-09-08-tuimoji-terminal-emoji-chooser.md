Tuimoji is a terminal (text) based emoji chooser, similar to gnome-characters, but
with less suck. ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ’»ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

I wrote tuimoji because searching for the appropriate emoji always seemed
cumbersome and was one of the least optimized portions of my workflow. Welcome to
my life.

As of now it only supports Linux. It requires python3 and `xclip` to be installed.
You can install it using pip:

    pip3 install tuimoji

There is also a package available on the [Arch Linux
AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tuimoji/).

The sources, as usual, are available on
[Github](https://github.com/Fingel/tuimoji).
