I've been spending more time you youtube lately, especially on Mondays while I recover from the weekend races. Here are a couple of bike related videos that really had me glued to the screen.

I didn't even know what a match sprint was before I saw thisÂ  video but after watching I want to head up to the Alpenrose velodrome and give it a shot. It's old school, and I don't think there are that many track stands in modern competition, but it is still very cool to watch:

Headbutting. I've got to try this. From last year's Tour, Mark Renshaw headbutts the competition:
