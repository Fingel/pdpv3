November is wildfire season in California, and this year has been no exception.
Just when we thought it couldn't get worse than 2017 / 2018, it did.

Unfortunately it can be super hard to get good information about wildfires while
they are happening. This is mainly due to every local news station eagerly
exploiting tragedy for readership. Googling a fire returns pages of poorly and hastily
written articles that contain, at best, out of date information (but plenty of
shocking cell phone video) and at worst no information at all.

If you are in danger of wildfire, you should always follow the direction of your
local emergency agencies.

If you're one of the other 40 million Californians that just want get some
straight information about fire boundaries, conditions and smoke without all the
hysteria and FUD, here are some official and reliable sources:

## InciWeb

[InciWeb](https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/) is an incident information system provided by
the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG). Basically, it aggregates the latest
information about wildfires directly from the local agencies that are in the
affected area.

The site provides basic information, the current situation, outlook and latest
reports from the commander(s) on the fire. This is the most reliable place to get
information such as cause, location, size, containment, as well total personnel
and estimated containment dates.

I guarantee InciWeb is where 99% of all local news companies get their
information. Skip the middleman.

## National Fire Situational Awareness Map

The [National Fire Situational Awareness Map](https://maps.nwcg.gov/sa/) is an
interactive map that overlays data directly from infrared satellites that can
detect fire from orbit. This data is used to make a map that very accurately
shows where fires are burning at any one moment. It also displays historical burn
areas. Absolutely the best way to see where and how hot a fire is burning. This
service is also provided by the NWCG.


## NASA EOSDIS Worldview

Wile not specific to wildfires, [Nasa's Worldview
application](https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/) is another interactive map
that shows near realtime satellite images of the earth as quickly as 3 hours
after observation. This is very similar to the National Fire Situational Awareness
Map except that it displays it's data in the optical instead of infrared, and it
allows you to go back in time. This is super useful for viewing current air quality
conditions and tracking smoke as it moves across the state (and country). An
amazing resource provided by the good folks at NASA.

Those are my go-to's. Do you have other resources you use during wildfire season?
If so, let me know in the comments!
