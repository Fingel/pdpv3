Yesterday I came across what is quite possibly the most badly designed bike rack I have
ever seen. May I present to you: the [Capitol Bike
Rack](https://www.forms-surfaces.com/capitol-bike-rack) by
[Forms+Surfaces](https://www.forms-surfaces.com/).

There were two of these side by side and at first it wasn't even clear to me
that they were supposed to be bike racks (none of them were occupied, of course).
Luckily they have a nice bike symbol stamped on them that eased my uncertainty, but
not my doubts. Indeed, I found it impossible to lock my bike to one of these using
my standard sized U-lock.

I ended up locking my bike to a bench, also designed by Forms + Surfaces, which
functioned much better as a bike rack.

These were so bad, that I decided to look them up. I found a [spec
sheet](https://www.forms-surfaces.com/sites/default/files/product-data-sheet/Capitol_Bike_Rack_PDS_3.pdf?vid=)
which claimed that the racks "Meet Association of Pedestrian and Bicycle
Professionals (APBP) guidelines."

Curious, what are these APBP guidelines and how bad do they have to be for this
rack to meet them?

It turns out the Association of Pedestrian and Bicycle Professionals do have a
pretty good set of guidelines for designing and installing bicycle parking in
their [Essentials of Bike
Parking](https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.apbp.org/resource/resmgr/Bicycle_Parking/EssentialsofBikeParking_FINA.pdf)
document.

The following table lists the guidelines and whether the Capitol Bike Rack, the
typical "inverted U" rack style, and a sign post meet them:

<table class="table">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Guidline</th>
            <th>Capitol Bike Rack</th>
            <th>Inverted U</th>
            <th>Sign Post</th>
        </tr>
    <thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>The rack should provide two points of contact with the frame.</td>
            <td>No</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
            <td>No</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Accommodates a variety of bicycles.</td>
            <td>No</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Allows locking of frame and at least one wheel with a U-lock. Rack tubes with a cross section larger than 2” can complicate the use of smaller U-locks..</td>
            <td>No (cross section is 4” according to spec sheet)</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Provides security and longevity features.</td>
            <td>Yes (if you can lock to it)</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Rack is intuitive.</td>
            <td>No</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

The Capitol Bike Rack **fails to completely meet a single guidline provided by the APBP.**
A no parking sign post meets more. I'm not sure how they can claim that they meet
these standards, but it is a blatant lie.

Please, if you are considering installing bicycle parking for your business or
development, install racks that actually work. The typical "inverted U" may be
boring, but they function.
