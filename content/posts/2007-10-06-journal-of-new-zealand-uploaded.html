I recently pulled all my journal entries I wrote while in New Zealand off of Facebook and put them in PDF form. They are complete with pictures, stories of adventure, danger, love and heartbreak. Be warned the file size is fairly large. Soon I will try to convert everything to HTML and make a page out of it.
You can find the journal <a title="New Zealand Notes pdf" href="http://www.fingel.com/misc/newzealandnotes.pdf" target="_self">here</a>
