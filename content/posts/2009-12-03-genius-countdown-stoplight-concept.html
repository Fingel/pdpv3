Why hasn't anyone thought of this before? Eko, a traffic light concept by <a href="http://relogik.com/" target="_blank">Damjan Stanković</a> that counts down the time until the light changes.  According to his description the benefits of the light include: Less fuel consumption because drivers can turn off their engine as they wait for the light to change. Less stress, you should be free to text message if you know the light wont change for another minute. What he forgot to mention was the huge benefit it would give to cyclists. Knowing when a light will change can mean not slamming on the brakes at the last minute at yellows, as well as saving energy from slowing down unnecessarily at reds about to turn green.

Very good stuff.
