title: The new Star Wars is Already Full of Fail
---

I was waiting in line at the supermarket this morning when I came across
this cover of the June 2015 Vanity Fair:

Immediately something struck me as very, very wrong.

I know we all hope the new Star Wars will be good and make up
for the complete travesty of episodes I, II and III. But I'm going to make a
quick and uninformed judgment based solely on this magazine cover and say: no,
no it won't.

The problem my friends, is Chewbacca. Chewbacca does *not* casually pose for
photographs. I mean just look at him! He's got his arm up on a chair all relaxed and
cool like he's James Dean or something. He's even got a disgusting smug smile
on his face and his head is cocked to the side as if he's waiting to complement
you on your haircut. Terrible. Also, is his face airbrushed? What
the hell!

This is the true Chewbacca:

Chewbacca is bigfoot in space: a vicious hairy beast who will rip off every
one of your appendages for accidentally touching his bowcaster. There were very
few scenes in the original Star Wars when he wasn't actively trying to damage
someone or something, much less acting calm and collected.

If you need any more proof that Hollywood is a mere impersonation of what it
once was, destroying everything good that it had once accomplished, look no
further. They are killing Star Wars - again.
