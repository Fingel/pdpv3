Recently I did a live tutorial with [CodingNomads](https://www.codingnomads.co)
on how to build an image sharing website (like Instagram) in Django. The demo
is meant to show how quickly you can leverage Django to build and prototype web
applications. You can [view it on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xahfqVN5ig).
